# blindkit

***Blindkit*** is a configurable CLI tool that converts a standard *34x34* blind image to the animated blind image with the sheen effect.

## How to use?

1. Put the blind texture you want to animate in the same folder as the executable
2. Run the executable and enter the blinds texture path
3. The final blind animation sprite-sheet should be saved to `output.png`

## How can I configure this?

Once downloading the build, you will see a `cfg.json` file. The `cfg.json` file contains options for sheen colour and sheen transparency.
